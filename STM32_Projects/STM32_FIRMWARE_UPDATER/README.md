- Firmware Updater for STM32 Nucleo Board (Probably It won't work for STM32F4 Discovery because we need Virtual Com for update)
- Used STM32CUDEIDE and aim to update via USB OTG. (I can send you all files if you can write me on my social media)
- I used UPDATER_exe to send executable file (.bin or .hex file)
